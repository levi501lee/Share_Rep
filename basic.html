<p>    Provide exceptional service to clients, a contagious passion for reaching goals, and proven leadership to the organization. Over ten years, four years active duty military and six years as a contractor, worked with a wide range of military personnel facilitating needs, providing training, and resolving challenges. Fitness and inspiring others were key in my previous positions. In the military, my physical fitness and ability to manage small teams led to several promotions ahead of my peer group and being awarded Honor Graduate at an intense leadership course. Selected for one of less than 350 slots to attend Air Assault school on Fort Bliss in 2015. While deployed as a civilian contractor amongst warfighters in Afghanistan, my knowledge and communication skills in both traditional and crossfit gyms led to outstanding cooperation in the office and the field. Currently volunteering at the Veteranâ€™s Hospital in Salt Lake on the TruthPoint survey initiative in order to identify improvements for both veterans and staff.
